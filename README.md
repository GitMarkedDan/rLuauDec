# rLuauDec
A Luau decompiler written entirely in Rust. Not all opcodes are supported right now.
This project is split into 3 different sections:
1. Reading opcodes
2. Decompilation
3. Serialization

## WARNING!
This project is currently extremely early WIP, pretty bare bones.
There will be many breaking changes!

Also not every opcode is supported currently.
